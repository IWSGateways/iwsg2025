        <p>Toulouse is a vibrant city of southwest France. CERFACS is located on the west outskirt of the city, not far from the metro station. There are hotels nearby but the area has no interest in the evening. We suggest to reserve an hotel in the centre of Toulouse, because it is very beautiful even if you have about 30 minutes of metro and bus to come to CERFACS. June can be a busy time, so we suggest to reserve your hotel rooms as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Here is a list of <a href = "https://cerfacs.fr/accommodation-hotel-booking/">recommended hotels</a>. </p>

Trains via Barcelona involve a change in Narbonne, and there are also direct trains to Valence and Nice.
		    You can check train times and fares for trains in France at the <a href="https://connect.sncf.com">SNCF</a> website. </span>

            <p>Toulouse is an historic city, called La ville Rose which translated to the Pink City, because of the colors of bricks used to build houses and buildings.</p>
<p>              It is a vibrant city thanks to its numerous universities and engineering schools, and with Airbus facilities: you will be able to see new airplanes built by Airbus being tested, as well as the Beluga-XXL which transports airplanelarge pieces. Airbus facilities can be visited (reservation required well in advance) and there is also an aviation museum with the Concorde and many other aircrafts that made the aviation history. The Cit&eacute; de l&apos;Espace is also a very interesting space museum where you can even go into a Soyouz Capsule or experience a simulator.</p>
<p>	      The centre of the town is known for its well-preserved medieval inner-city and the stunning views of the Garonne River. Often it is possible to see, from the city, the Pyrenees Mountain Range which separates France and Spain. Around Toulouse you can find pittoresque medieval villages and Cathares castles. Several wineries also produce very good red wines, like Fronton, Corbi&egrave;res, Madiran, Gaillac and Cahors. If driving, it is located 1h30 from the Pyrenees, 1h30 from the Meditteranean Sea, 1h from Carcassonne, 1h from Albi, 2h from Spain, 2h30 from the Ocean and also Montpellier. There are also direct trains to Foix, Ax-les-Thermes, Carcassonne, Narbonne, Cahors, Bordeaux, Pau, Montpellier, Marseille. Carcassonne is one of the most beautiful and impressive historical site in France. It is really worth the visit and only 1h away. The same can be said for Foix, an old medieval city at the foothills of the Pyrenees. </p>


<p>Toulouse and southwest France will surprise you: do not forget to also do gastronomy visits by going to many of the very high quality cuisine restaurants, either very fancy or closer to the typical dishes of southwest France like Cassoulet, Magret de Canard or Foie Gras. Wine from the region and also cheeses from the Pyrenees are also a must to taste!</p>
