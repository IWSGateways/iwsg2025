<p>Trento is located in one of the most fascinating
Italian regions: Trentino. Known for its mountains, the Dolomites,
one of UNESCO's world heritage sites, Trentino is a borderland
between the Mediterranean area and Central Europe. The region
has always benefited from its location to innovate and create
new ideas, a sort of Silicon Valley in the Alps, as some media
have dubbed it.
An ideal place to live, have fun, practice sport.
<p>Trento will surprise you: a small, ever evolving city that remains
deeply attached to its traditions. In 2014 it was selected as one
of the best 10 "smart cities" in the world.</p>
