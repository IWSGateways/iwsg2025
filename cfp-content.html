   <p>Science Gateways support scientists throughout the stages of the research cycle, including data collection and annotation, processing and analysis of complex scientific data, and collaborative work and publication of research data.
       They bridge community and domain-specific expertise with modern information technologies such as the Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and hybrid Cloud environments.
       Through them, scientists are able to tap the full potential of their scientific data. Further, they facilitate the access to compute resources improving science through the employment of reproducible workflows.</p>

   <p>We invite the submission of papers related to Science Gateways.
   Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
   <ul>
   <li style="list-style-type: none;">
   <ul>
       <li>Architectures, frameworks and technologies for Science Gateways</li>
       <li>Science Gateways sustaining collaborative communities</li>
       <li>Research data management through Science Gateways</li>
       <li>Support for scalability and data-driven methods in Science Gateways</li>
       <li>Improving the reproducibility of science in Science Gateways</li>
       <li>Science Gateway usability, portals, workflows and tools</li>
       <li>Software engineering approaches supporting scientific work</li>
       <li>Aspects of Science Gateways, such as security and stability</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   </ul>
   <p>We particularly encourage submissions from application scientists and community members reporting their firsthand experiences with science gateways.
       There are three forms of presentation: </p>
