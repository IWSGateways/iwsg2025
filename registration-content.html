        <p>Toulouse is a vibrant city of southwest France. CERFACS is located on the west outskirt of the city, not far from the metro station. There are hotels nearby but the area has no interest in the evening. We suggest to reserve an hotel in the centre of Toulouse, because it is very beautiful even if you have about 30 minutes of metro and bus to come to CERFACS. June can be a busy time, so we suggest to reserve your hotel rooms as soon as possible!</p>
        <p>Here is a list of <a href = "https://cerfacs.fr/accommodation-hotel-booking/">recommended hotels</a>. </p>
